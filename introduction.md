# The Daily PL - Introduction (Class 1)

Welcome to the1<sup>st</sup> edition of the *Daily PL* for the Fall 2023
volume of CS3003. It's an honor to have such a high circulation. We have
almost as many daily subscribers as the *Wall Street Journal* or the
*Cincinnati Enquirer* (there is, sadly, almost truth to that facetious
statement about the latter). Throughout the semester I,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman"
class="inline_disabled external" target="_blank"
rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Will Kent</span></a>, will write
(sometimes not so) short recaps of what we discuss in class. These
materials are for you to use to learn and are *absolutely* a resource
that you can rely on during the exams and when you do your homework. I
hope that you enjoy!

> Editor's note: I know that we did not get to cover everything in this
> issue in class today -- don't worry, we'll continue on Wednesday!

### Definitions:

1.  programming language: A system of communicating computational ideas
    between people and computing machines.
2.  high-level programming language: A programming language that is
    independent of any particular machine architecture.
3.  syntax: The rules for constructing structurally *valid* (note:
    *valid*, not *correct*) computer programs in a particular language.
4.  names: A means of identifying "entities" in a programming language.
5.  types: A way to denote the categories of values that a program can
    manipulate. (A more specific definition will come later in the
    course). 
6.  semantics: The effect of each statement's execution on the program's
    operation.

Concepts:

- There are (three or) four (depending on how you count) fundamental
  components of every programming language: *syntax, names, types,* and
  *semantics.*

### Practice:

For your favorite programming language, attempt to explain the most
meaningful parts of its syntax. Think about what are valid identifiers
in the language, how statements are separated, whether blocks of code
are put inside braces, etc.

Next, ask yourself how your favorite language handles types. Are
variables in the language given types explicitly or implicitly? If the
language is compiled, are types assigned to variables before the code is
compiled or as the program executes? These are issues that we will
discuss in detail in Module 2.

Finally, think about how statements in your favorite programming
language affect the program's execution. Does the language have loops?
if-then statements? function composition? goto?
